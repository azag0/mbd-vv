  abstract = {Treating both many-body polarization and dispersion interactions is now recognized as a key element in achieving the level of atomistic modeling required to reveal novel physics in complex systems. The quantum Drude oscillator (QDO), a Gaussian-based, coarse grained electronic structure model, captures both many-body polarization and dispersion and has linear scale computational complexity with system size, hence it is a leading candidate next-generation simulation method. Here, we investigate the extent to which the QDO treatment reproduces the desired long-range atomic and molecular properties. We present closed form expressions for leading order polarizabilities and dispersion coefficients and derive invariant (parameter-free) scaling relationships among multipole polarizability and many-body dispersion coefficients that arise due to the Gaussian nature of the model. We show that these ``combining rules'' hold to within a few percent for noble gas atoms, alkali metals, and simple (first-row hydride) molecules such as water; this is consistent with the surprising success that models with underlying Gaussian statistics often exhibit in physics. We present a diagrammatic Jastrow-type perturbation theory tailored to the QDO model that serves to illustrate the rich types of responses that the QDO approach engenders. QDO models for neon, argon, krypton, and xenon, designed to reproduce gas phase properties, are constructed and their condensed phase properties explored via linear scale diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations. Good agreement with experimental data for structure, cohesive energy, and bulk modulus is found, demonstrating a degree of transferability that cannot be achieved using current empirical models or fully ab initio descriptions.},

  doi = {10.1063/1.4865104},
  abstract = {An accurate determination of the electron correlation energy is an essential prerequisite for describing the structure, stability, and function in a wide variety of systems. Therefore, the development of efficient approaches for the calculation of the correlation energy (and hence the dispersion energy as well) is essential and such methods can be coupled with many density-functional approximations, local methods for the electron correlation energy, and even interatomic force fields. In this work, we build upon the previously developed many-body dispersion (MBD) framework, which is intimately linked to the random-phase approximation for the correlation energy. We separate the correlation energy into short-range contributions that are modeled by semi-local functionals and long-range contributions that are calculated by mapping the complex all-electron problem onto a set of atomic response functions coupled in the dipole approximation. We propose an effective range-separation of the coupling between the atomic response functions that extends the already broad applicability of the MBD method to non-metallic materials with highly anisotropic responses, such as layered nanostructures. Application to a variety of high-quality benchmark datasets illustrates the accuracy and applicability of the improved MBD approach, which offers the prospect of first-principles modeling of large structurally complex systems with an accurate description of the long-range correlation energy.},

  abstract = {With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.},

In this paper, the vdW-DF correlation functional is modified to make it better compatible with accurate exchange functionals. We suggest a slightly simplified construction of the nonlocal correlation, yielding more accurate asymptotic C(6) coefficients. We also derive a gradient correction, containing a parameter that can be adjusted to suit an exchange functional of choice.

  abstract = {Recently we have demonstrated that the applicability of the Tkatchenko-Scheffler (TS) method for calculating dispersion corrections to density-functional theory can be extended to ionic systems if the Hirshfeld method for estimating effective volumes and charges of atoms in molecules or solids (AIM's) is replaced by its iterative variant [T. Bu{\v c}ko, S. Leb{\`e}gue, J. Hafner, and J. {\'A}ngy{\'a}n, J. Chem. Theory Comput.9, 4293 (2013)]. The standard Hirshfeld method uses neutral atoms as a reference, whereas in the iterative Hirshfeld (HI) scheme the fractionally charged atomic reference states are determined self-consistently. We show that the HI method predicts more realistic AIM charges and that the TS/HI approach leads to polarizabilities and C 6 dispersion coefficients in ionic or partially ionic systems which are, as expected, larger for anions than for cations (in contrast to the conventional TS method). For crystalline materials, the new algorithm predicts polarizabilities per unit cell in better agreement with the values derived from the Clausius-Mosotti equation. The applicability of the TS/HI method has been tested for a wide variety of molecular and solid-state systems. It is demonstrated that for systems dominated by covalent interactions and/or dispersion forces the TS/HI method leads to the same results as the conventional TS approach. The difference between the TS/HI and TS approaches increases with increasing ionicity. A detailed comparison is presented for isoelectronic series of octet compounds, layered crystals, complex intermetallic compounds, and hydrides, and for crystals built of molecules or containing molecular anions. It is demonstrated that only the TS/HI method leads to accurate results for systems where both electrostatic and dispersion interactions are important, as illustrated for Li-intercalated graphite and for molecular adsorption on the surfaces in ionic solids and in the cavities of zeolites.},

  abstract = {A new method to calculate the atom-atom dispersion coefficients in a molecule is proposed for the use in density functional theory with dispersion (DFT-D) correction. The method is based on the local response approximation due to Dobson and Dinte [Phys. Rev. Lett.76, 1780 (1996)], with modified dielectric model recently proposed by Vydrov and van Voorhis [J. Chem. Phys.130, 104105 (2009)]. The local response model is used to calculate the distributed multipole polarizabilities of atoms in a molecule, from which the dispersion coefficients are obtained by an explicit frequency integral of the Casimir\textendash{}Polder type. Thus obtained atomic polarizabilities are also used in the damping function for the short-range singularity. Unlike empirical DFT-D methods, the local response dispersion (LRD) method is able to calculate the dispersion energy from the ground-state electron density only. It is applicable to any geometry, free from physical constants such as van der Waals radii or atomic polarizabilities, and computationally very efficient. The LRD method combined with the long-range corrected DFT functional (LC-BOP) is applied to calculations of S22 weakly bound complex set [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.8, 1985 (2006)]. Binding energies obtained by the LC-BOP + LRD agree remarkably well with ab initio references.},

  abstract = {Interatomic pairwise methods are currently among the most popular and accurate ways to include dispersion energy in density functional theory calculations. However, when applied to more than two atoms, these methods are still frequently perceived to be based on ad hoc assumptions, rather than a rigorous derivation from quantum mechanics. Starting from the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) theorem, an exact expression for the electronic exchange-correlation energy, we demonstrate that the pairwise interatomic dispersion energy for an arbitrary collection of isotropic polarizable dipoles emerges from the second-order expansion of the ACFD formula upon invoking the random-phase approximation (RPA) or the full-potential approximation. Moreover, for a system of quantum harmonic oscillators coupled through a dipole-dipole potential, we prove the equivalence between the full interaction energy obtained from the Hamiltonian diagonalization and the ACFD-RPA correlation energy. This property makes the Hamiltonian diagonalization an efficient method for the calculation of the many-body dispersion energy. In addition, we show that the switching function used to damp the dispersion interaction at short distances arises from a short-range screened Coulomb potential, whose role is to account for the spatial spread of the individual atomic dipole moments. By using the ACFD formula, we gain a deeper understanding of the approximations made in the interatomic pairwise approaches, providing a powerful formalism for further development of accurate and efficient methods for the calculation of the dispersion energy.},

  abstract = {An accurate treatment of the long-range electron correlation energy, including van der Waals (vdW) or dispersion interactions, is essential for describing the structure, dynamics, and function of a wide variety of systems. Among the most accurate models for including dispersion into density functional theory (DFT) is the range-separated many-body dispersion (MBD) method [A. Ambrosetti et al., J. Chem. Phys., 2014, 140, 18A508], in which the correlation energy is modeled at short-range by a semi-local density functional and at long-range by a model system of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators. In this work, we develop analytical gradients of the MBD energy with respect to nuclear coordinates, including all implicit coordinate dependencies arising from the partitioning of the charge density into Hirshfeld effective volumes. To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of these MBD gradients for geometry optimizations of systems with intermolecular and intramolecular interactions, we optimized conformers of the benzene dimer and isolated small peptides with aromatic side-chains. We find excellent agreement with the wavefunction theory reference geometries of these systems (at a fraction of the computational cost) and find that MBD consistently outperforms the popular TS and D3(BJ) dispersion corrections. To demonstrate the performance of the MBD model on a larger system with supramolecular interactions, we optimized the C60@C60H28 buckyball catcher host\textendash{}guest complex. In our analysis, we also find that neglecting the implicit nuclear coordinate dependence arising from the charge density partitioning, as has been done in prior numerical treatments, leads to an unacceptable error in the MBD forces, with relative errors of $\sim$20\% (on average) that can extend well beyond 100\%.},

The method is also applied to calculations of potential energy curves of molecules in the S22 database [P. Jure{\v c}ka et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.8, 1985 (2006)]. The calculated potential energy curves are in a good agreement with reliable benchmarks recently published by Molnar et al. [J. Chem. Phys.131, 065102 (2009)]. These improvements are achieved at the price of increasing complexity in the implementation, but without losing the computational efficiency of the previous two-center (atom-atom) formulation.

  abstract = {A ``best-of-both-worlds'' van der Waals (vdW) density functional is constructed, seamlessly supplementing the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient approximation for short- and intermediate-range interactions with the long-range vdW interaction from rVV10, the revised Vydrov\textendash{}van Voorhis nonlocal correlation functional. The resultant SCAN+rVV10 is the only vdW density functional to date that yields excellent interlayer binding energies and spacings, as well as intralayer lattice constants in 28 layered materials. Its versatility for various kinds of bonding is further demonstrated by its good performance for 22 interactions between molecules; the cohesive energies and lattice constants of 50 solids; the adsorption energy and distance of a benzene molecule on coinage-metal surfaces; the binding energy curves for graphene on Cu(111), Ni(111), and Co(0001) surfaces; and the rare-gas solids. We argue that a good semilocal approximation should (as SCAN does) capture the intermediate-range vdW through its exchange term. We have found an effective range of the vdW interaction between 8 and 16 {\AA} for systems considered here, suggesting that this interaction is negligibly small at the larger distances where it reaches its asymptotic power-law decay.},

In reality, the force saturates because the electrons cannot respond to fields of very short wavelength: polarization charges are always smeared out to some degree and in consequence the response is nonlocal. Nonlocality also plays an important role in the optical spectrum and distribution of the modes but introduces complexity into calculations, hindering an analytical solution for interactions at the nanometer scale. Here, taking as an example the case of two touching nanospheres, we show for the first time, to our knowledge, that nonlocality in 3D plasmonic systems can be accurately analyzed using the transformation optics approach. The effects of nonlocality are found to dramatically weaken the field enhancement between the spheres and hence the van der Waals interaction and to modify the spectral shifts of plasmon modes.},

A double Lorentzian oscillator is used to describe the frequency-dependent atomic polarizabilities, while a single Lorentzian oscillator is used to describe the frequency-dependent atomic capacitances. All atomic parameters have been optimized using reference data obtained from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. As a comprehensive test of our model, we have studied the frequency-dependent polarizabilities of quasi-spherical silver nanoclusters having different structural motifs, i.e., icosahedra, truncated Ino and Marks decahedra, and regular truncated octahedra and cubocahedra. We have shown that clusters in all five structural motifs exhibit a strong absorption peak in the spectral region of 2.4-4.8 eV, although the size evolution of absorption peak location and peak width depends strongly on the number of atoms and the atomic arrangements of the clusters.},

The Casimir force, through a close connection to classical photonics, can depend strongly on the shapes and compositions of the objects, stimulating a decades-long search for geometries in which the force behaves very differently from the monotonic attractive force first predicted by Casimir. Recent theoretical and experimental developments have led to a new understanding of the force in complex microstructured geometries, including through recent theoretical predictions of Casimir repulsion between vacuum-separated metals, the stable suspension of objects and unusual non-additive and temperature effects, as well as experimental observations of repulsion in fluids, non-additive forces in nanotrench surfaces and the influence of new material choices.},

  abstract = {In this work we have presented a capacitance-polarizability interaction model for describing the polarizability of large metal clusters. The model consists of interacting atomic capacitances and polarizabilities that are optimized to reproduce the full polarizability tensors of medium sized (N $\leq$ 68) gold and silver clusters. The reference polarizability tensors have been calculated using time-dependent density functional theory and shown good agreement with experimental results. We have shown that very good agreement between the model and the DFT results can be achieved both for the isotropic and anisotropic polarizability as a function of size, thus providing an accurate description of the polarizability of noble metal clusters. The model is computationally efficient and can easily handle cluster several nm in radius, thus, provides a natural bridge between the quantum mechanical methods and the macroscopic electrodynamic description. This allowed us to study the polarizability of silver and gold clusters having different shapes, i.e., spheres, rods, and disks, and sizes having diameters as large as 4.5 nm, thus, reaching the saturation of the polarizability. By partitioning the total polarizability into effective atomic polarizabilities that depend on the atomic position in the cluster, we provide a physical picture of the saturation of the polarizability of metal clusters as a function of size. This illustrates that the onset of the saturation occurs as the cluster starts to have a core of atoms showing bulk-like polarizabilities, surrounded by layers of atoms with surface-like polarizabilities. For larger clusters we see that the bulk core grows whereas the surface layers keep roughly the same thickness thus leading to a saturation of the polarizability as the size of the cluster increases.},

The full QED Hamiltonian consists of 3 terms: the pure electromagnetic term H em , the pure matter term H matt and the interaction term H int . The H em -term commutes with all matter fields because it does not have any explicit dependence on matter fields. As a consequence, H em cannot generate any forces on matter. Since it is precisely this term that generates the vacuum energy of EM field, it follows that the vacuum energy does not generate the forces. The misleading statements in the literature that vacuum energy generates Casimir force can be boiled down to the fact that H em attains an implicit dependence on matter fields by the use of the equations of motion and to the illegitimate treatment of the implicit dependence as if it was explicit. The true origin of the Casimir force is van der Waals force generated by H int .},

  abstract = {A robust and general solver for the radial Schr{\"o}dinger, Dirac, and Kohn\textendash{}Sham equations is presented. The formulation admits general potentials and meshes: uniform, exponential, or other defined by nodal distribution and derivative functions. For a given mesh type, convergence can be controlled systematically by increasing the number of grid points. Radial integrations are carried out using a combination of asymptotic forms, Runge\textendash{}Kutta, and implicit Adams methods. Eigenfunctions are determined by a combination of bisection and perturbation methods for robustness and speed. An outward Poisson integration is employed to increase accuracy in the core region, allowing absolute accuracies of 10-8 Hartree to be attained for total energies of heavy atoms such as uranium. Detailed convergence studies are presented and computational parameters are provided to achieve accuracies commonly required in practice. Comparisons to analytic and current-benchmark density-functional results for atomic number Z = 1 \textendash{} 92 are presented, verifying and providing a refinement to current benchmarks. An efficient, modular Fortran 95 implementation, dftatom, is provided as open source, including examples, tests, and wrappers for interface to other languages; wherein particular emphasis is placed on the independence (no global variables), reusability, and generality of the individual routines.

  doi = {10.1103/PhysRevA.65.012506},
  abstract = {Dynamic dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities as well as shielding factors of the beryllium atom in the ground state were computed at real frequencies by using the variation-perturbation method. The zeroth- and the first-order wave functions were expanded in many-electron basis of exponentially correlated Gaussian functions. The 1600-term expansion of the unperturbed wave function yielded the ground-state energy accurate to 1cm-1. The first-order wave functions were expanded in very large bases (4800 and 4400 terms). The nonlinear parameters of the first-order correction functions were optimized with respect to both the static and dynamic polarizabilities, and with respect to the excited-state energies. The procedure employed ensures a high accuracy of determination of dynamic properties in a wide range of frequencies and correct positions of the transition poles. Test calculations, performed on He and Li, confirmed the ability of this method to obtain the atomic properties with very high accuracy. The final values of the static properties of Be were 37.755e2a20E-1H and 300.96e2a40E-1H for the dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities, respectively, and 1.4769 for the quadrupole shielding factor. The convergence of the atomic properties with the size of the expansion of both the zeroth- and first-order functions was checked. Thanks to very high accuracy of the unperturbed wave function and the efficient method of construction of the first-order wave functions, the dynamic polarizability results presented in this work are of benchmark quality. As a by-product of this project, a set of the most accurate upper bounds to the energies of 1P and 1D states of Be was obtained.},

Both effects are found to be of importance and, when included, lead to satisfactory agreement with available experimental data on dipole polarizabilities. The influence of consistency effects is always found to reduce the polarizabilities with respect to the free ions while the influence of the crystal environment leads to a decrease for anions and an increase for cations. Comparison is also made for free ions with experimental results, and with theoretical results from other approaches to focus on the accuracy of calculated consistency contributions. Physical reasons are discussed for the observed trends in the various contributions to the polarizabilities for both free ions and ions in crystals.},

These simple systems show surprising diversity of electronic properties ranging from more ``metallic'' to more ``insulator'' like, a property which needs to be captured in the approximate methods. While none of the standard approximate DFT theories provides an entirely satisfactory description of all the systems, we identify the most reliable approaches of each type. In addition, we show that results can be further tuned to chemical accuracy. In vdW-DF theory, guided by physical insights and the availability of quasi-exact CCSD(T) results, we supply the missing parts of correlation by matching an appropriate hybrid/semilocal exchange-correlation functional to describe short-/medium-range correlations accurately. In the DFT-D-type of theories, we reparametrize the empirical dispersion term. Since for such an accurate treatment benchmark calculations are needed, which typically is feasible only for a finite cluster, we argue that the cluster based model of the exchange-correlation hole is transferrable also to extended systems with vdW dispersion interactions.},

  abstract = {Due to its efficiency and reasonable accuracy, density functional theory is one of the most widely used electronic structure theories in condensed matter physics, materials physics, and quantum chemistry. The accuracy and efficiency of a density functional is dependent on the basic ingredients it uses, and how the ingredients are built into the functional as a whole. An iso-orbital indicator based on the electron density, its gradients, and the kinetic energy density, has proven an essential dimensionless variable that allows density functionals to recognise and correctly treat various types of chemical bonding, both strong and weak. Density functionals constructed around the iso-orbital indicator usually require dense real-space grids for numerical implementation that deteriorate computational efficiency, with poor grid convergence compromising the improved accuracy. Here, a novel iso-orbital indicator is proposed based on the same ingredients that retains the capability to identify the same chemical bonds while significantly relieving the requirement of dense grids, and giving an improved recognition for tail regions of electron densities. The novel iso-orbital indicator is therefore expected to be the prime choice for further density functional development.},
