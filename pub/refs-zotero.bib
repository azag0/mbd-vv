  abstract = {Noncovalent interactions are ubiquitous in molecular and condensed-phase environments, and hence a reliable theoretical description of these fundamental interactions could pave the way toward a more complete understanding of the microscopic underpinnings for a diverse set of systems in chemistry and biology. In this work, we demonstrate that recent algorithmic advances coupled to the availability of large-scale computational resources make the stochastic quantum Monte Carlo approach to solving the Schr\"odinger equation an optimal contender for attaining ?chemical accuracy? (1 kcal/mol) in the binding energies of supramolecular complexes of chemical relevance. To illustrate this point, we considered a select set of seven host?guest complexes, representing the spectrum of noncovalent interactions, including dispersion or van der Waals forces, $\pi$?$\pi$ stacking, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic (ion?dipole) attraction. A detailed analysis of the interaction energies reveals that a complete theoretical description necessitates treatment of terms well beyond the standard London and Axilrod?Teller contributions to the van der Waals dispersion energy.},

  abstract = {Treating both many-body polarization and dispersion interactions is now recognized as a key element in achieving the level of atomistic modeling required to reveal novel physics in complex systems. The quantum Drude oscillator (QDO), a Gaussian-based, coarse grained electronic structure model, captures both many-body polarization and dispersion and has linear scale computational complexity with system size, hence it is a leading candidate next-generation simulation method. Here, we investigate the extent to which the QDO treatment reproduces the desired long-range atomic and molecular properties. We present closed form expressions for leading order polarizabilities and dispersion coefficients and derive invariant (parameter-free) scaling relationships among multipole polarizability and many-body dispersion coefficients that arise due to the Gaussian nature of the model. We show that these ``combining rules'' hold to within a few percent for noble gas atoms, alkali metals, and simple (first-row hydride) molecules such as water; this is consistent with the surprising success that models with underlying Gaussian statistics often exhibit in physics. We present a diagrammatic Jastrow-type perturbation theory tailored to the QDO model that serves to illustrate the rich types of responses that the QDO approach engenders. QDO models for neon, argon, krypton, and xenon, designed to reproduce gas phase properties, are constructed and their condensed phase properties explored via linear scale diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations. Good agreement with experimental data for structure, cohesive energy, and bulk modulus is found, demonstrating a degree of transferability that cannot be achieved using current empirical models or fully ab initio descriptions.},

  doi = {10.1063/1.4865104},
  abstract = {An accurate determination of the electron correlation energy is an essential prerequisite for describing the structure, stability, and function in a wide variety of systems. Therefore, the development of efficient approaches for the calculation of the correlation energy (and hence the dispersion energy as well) is essential and such methods can be coupled with many density-functional approximations, local methods for the electron correlation energy, and even interatomic force fields. In this work, we build upon the previously developed many-body dispersion (MBD) framework, which is intimately linked to the random-phase approximation for the correlation energy. We separate the correlation energy into short-range contributions that are modeled by semi-local functionals and long-range contributions that are calculated by mapping the complex all-electron problem onto a set of atomic response functions coupled in the dipole approximation. We propose an effective range-separation of the coupling between the atomic response functions that extends the already broad applicability of the MBD method to non-metallic materials with highly anisotropic responses, such as layered nanostructures. Application to a variety of high-quality benchmark datasets illustrates the accuracy and applicability of the improved MBD approach, which offers the prospect of first-principles modeling of large structurally complex systems with an accurate description of the long-range correlation energy.},

  abstract = {With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.},

In this paper, the vdW-DF correlation functional is modified to make it better compatible with accurate exchange functionals.

Our computations reveal the nature of binding by improving on previously inaccessible or inaccurate multibody and many-electron contributions and provide revised estimates of the effects of temperature, vibrations, and relaxation. Our demonstration raises prospects for definitive first-principles resolution of competing polymorphs in molecular crystal structure prediction.
Working out how to pack benzene in silico
Many organic compounds crystallize in several different energetically similar packing arrangements, or polymorphs. This complicates processes such as drug formulation that rely on reproducible crystallization. Yang et al. have now achieved the long-standing goal of calculating a crystal packing arrangement from first principles to an accuracy that can distinguish polymorphs (see the Perspective by Price). They used benzene as a prototypical test case and applied quantum chemical methods that improve estimates of multibody interactions. The results bode well for future applications of theory to optimization of crystallization protocols.

  abstract = {Recently we have demonstrated that the applicability of the Tkatchenko-Scheffler (TS) method for calculating dispersion corrections to density-functional theory can be extended to ionic systems if the Hirshfeld method for estimating effective volumes and charges of atoms in molecules or solids (AIM's) is replaced by its iterative variant [T. Bu{\v c}ko, S. Leb\`egue, J. Hafner, and J. \'Angy\'an, J. Chem. Theory Comput.9, 4293 (2013)]. The standard Hirshfeld method uses neutral atoms as a reference, whereas in the iterative Hirshfeld (HI) scheme the fractionally charged atomic reference states are determined self-consistently. We show that the HI method predicts more realistic AIM charges and that the TS/HI approach leads to polarizabilities and C 6 dispersion coefficients in ionic or partially ionic systems which are, as expected, larger for anions than for cations (in contrast to the conventional TS method). For crystalline materials, the new algorithm predicts polarizabilities per unit cell in better agreement with the values derived from the Clausius-Mosotti equation. The applicability of the TS/HI method has been tested for a wide variety of molecular and solid-state systems. It is demonstrated that for systems dominated by covalent interactions and/or dispersion forces the TS/HI method leads to the same results as the conventional TS approach. The difference between the TS/HI and TS approaches increases with increasing ionicity. A detailed comparison is presented for isoelectronic series of octet compounds, layered crystals, complex intermetallic compounds, and hydrides, and for crystals built of molecules or containing molecular anions. It is demonstrated that only the TS/HI method leads to accurate results for systems where both electrostatic and dispersion interactions are important, as illustrated for Li-intercalated graphite and for molecular adsorption on the surfaces in ionic solids and in the cavities of zeolites.},

Thus obtained atomic polarizabilities are also used in the damping function for the short-range singularity. Unlike empirical DFT-D methods, the local response dispersion (LRD) method is able to calculate the dispersion energy from the ground-state electron density only. It is applicable to any geometry, free from physical constants such as van der Waals radii or atomic polarizabilities, and computationally very efficient. The LRD method combined with the long-range corrected DFT functional (LC-BOP) is applied to calculations of S22 weakly bound complex set [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.8, 1985 (2006)].

  abstract = {Interatomic pairwise methods are currently among the most popular and accurate ways to include dispersion energy in density functional theory calculations. However, when applied to more than two atoms, these methods are still frequently perceived to be based on ad hoc assumptions, rather than a rigorous derivation from quantum mechanics. Starting from the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) theorem, an exact expression for the electronic exchange-correlation energy, we demonstrate that the pairwise interatomic dispersion energy for an arbitrary collection of isotropic polarizable dipoles emerges from the second-order expansion of the ACFD formula upon invoking the random-phase approximation (RPA) or the full-potential approximation. Moreover, for a system of quantum harmonic oscillators coupled through a dipole-dipole potential, we prove the equivalence between the full interaction energy obtained from the Hamiltonian diagonalization and the ACFD-RPA correlation energy. This property makes the Hamiltonian diagonalization an efficient method for the calculation of the many-body dispersion energy. In addition, we show that the switching function used to damp the dispersion interaction at short distances arises from a short-range screened Coulomb potential, whose role is to account for the spatial spread of the individual atomic dipole moments. By using the ACFD formula, we gain a deeper understanding of the approximations made in the interatomic pairwise approaches, providing a powerful formalism for further development of accurate and efficient methods for the calculation of the dispersion energy.},

However, an accurate description of dispersion is highly challenging, with the most widely used electronic structure technique, density functional theory (DFT), failing to describe them with standard approximations. Therefore, applications of DFT to systems where dispersion is important have traditionally been of questionable accuracy. However, the last decade has seen a surge of enthusiasm in the DFT community to tackle this problem and in so-doing to extend the applicability of DFT-based methods. Here we discuss, classify, and evaluate some of the promising schemes to emerge in recent years. A brief perspective on the outstanding issues that remain to be resolved and some directions for future research are also provided.},

  title = {Accurate Description of van Der {{Waals}} Complexes by Density Functional Theory Including Empirical Corrections},
  volume = {25},
  doi = {10.1002/jcc.20078},
  abstract = {An empirical method to account for van der Waals interactions in practical calculations with the density functional theory (termed DFT-D) is tested for a wide variety of molecular complexes. As in previous schemes, the dispersive energy is described by damped interatomic potentials of the form C6R-6. The use of pure, gradient-corrected density functionals (BLYP and PBE), together with the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation for the Coulomb operator, allows very efficient computations for large systems. Opposed to previous work, extended AO basis sets of polarized TZV or QZV quality are employed, which reduces the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend. By using a global scaling factor for the atomic C6 coefficients, the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced. The ``double counting'' of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes is found to be insignificant if steep damping functions are employed. The method is applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small molecules (Ne, CH4, NH3, H2O, CH3F, N2, F2, formic acid, ethene, and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene dimers, the naphthalene trimer, coronene $\cdot$ H2O and four H-bonded and stacked DNA base pairs (AT and GC). In almost all cases, very good agreement with reliable theoretical or experimental results for binding energies and intermolecular distances is obtained. For stacked aromatic systems and the important base pairs, the DFT-D-BLYP model seems to be even superior to standard MP2 treatments that systematically overbind. The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems in chemistry. Furthermore, the DFT-D data may either be used to calibrate much simpler (e.g., force-field) potentials or the optimized structures can be used as input for more accurate ab initio calculations of the interaction energies. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Mean-field electronic structure methods like Hartree\textendash{}Fock, semilocal density functional approximations, or semiempirical molecular orbital (MO) theories do not account for long-range electron correlation (London dispersion interaction). Inclusion of these effects is mandatory for realistic calculations on large or condensed chemical systems and for various intramolecular phenomena (thermochemistry). This Review describes the recent developments (including some historical aspects) of dispersion corrections with an emphasis on methods that can be employed routinely with reasonable accuracy in large-scale applications. The most prominent correction schemes are classified into three groups: (i) nonlocal, density-based functionals, (ii) semiclassical C6-based, and (iii) one-electron effective potentials. The properties as well as pros and cons of these methods are critically discussed, and typical examples and benchmarks on molecular complexes and crystals are provided. Although there are some areas for further improvement (robustness, many-body and short-range effects), the situation regarding the overall accuracy is clear. Various approaches yield long-range dispersion energies with a typical relative error of 5\%. For many chemical problems, this accuracy is higher compared to that of the underlying mean-field method (i.e., a typical semilocal (hybrid) functional like B3LYP).},

  abstract = {An accurate treatment of the long-range electron correlation energy, including van der Waals (vdW) or dispersion interactions, is essential for describing the structure, dynamics, and function of a wide variety of systems. Among the most accurate models for including dispersion into density functional theory (DFT) is the range-separated many-body dispersion (MBD) method [A. Ambrosetti et al., J. Chem. Phys., 2014, 140, 18A508], in which the correlation energy is modeled at short-range by a semi-local density functional and at long-range by a model system of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators. In this work, we develop analytical gradients of the MBD energy with respect to nuclear coordinates, including all implicit coordinate dependencies arising from the partitioning of the charge density into Hirshfeld effective volumes. To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of these MBD gradients for geometry optimizations of systems with intermolecular and intramolecular interactions, we optimized conformers of the benzene dimer and isolated small peptides with aromatic side-chains. We find excellent agreement with the wavefunction theory reference geometries of these systems (at a fraction of the computational cost) and find that MBD consistently outperforms the popular TS and D3(BJ) dispersion corrections. To demonstrate the performance of the MBD model on a larger system with supramolecular interactions, we optimized the C60@C60H28 buckyball catcher host\textendash{}guest complex. In our analysis, we also find that neglecting the implicit nuclear coordinate dependence arising from the charge density partitioning, as has been done in prior numerical treatments, leads to an unacceptable error in the MBD forces, with relative errors of $\sim$20\% (on average) that can extend well beyond 100\%.},

Phys.131, 224104 (2009)], which is a first-principles alternative to empirical dispersion corrections in density functional theory, is implemented with generalized multicenter interactions involving both atomic and atomic pair polarizabilities. The generalization improves the asymptote of intermolecular interactions, reducing the mean absolute percentage error from about 30\% to 6\% in the molecular C 6 coefficients of more than 1000 dimers, compared to experimental values. The method is also applied to calculations of potential energy curves of molecules in the S22 database [P. Jure{\v c}ka et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.8, 1985 (2006)]. The calculated potential energy curves are in a good agreement with reliable benchmarks recently published by Molnar et al. [J. Chem. Phys.131, 065102 (2009)]. These improvements are achieved at the price of increasing complexity in the implementation, but without losing the computational efficiency of the previous two-center (atom-atom) formulation. A set of different truncations of two-center and three- or four-center interactions is shown to be optimal in the cost-performance balance.},

The resultant SCAN+rVV10 is the only vdW density functional to date that yields excellent interlayer binding energies and spacings, as well as intralayer lattice constants in 28 layered materials. Its versatility for various kinds of bonding is further demonstrated by its good performance for 22 interactions between molecules; the cohesive energies and lattice constants of 50 solids; the adsorption energy and distance of a benzene molecule on coinage-metal surfaces; the binding energy curves for graphene on Cu(111), Ni(111), and Co(0001) surfaces; and the rare-gas solids. We argue that a good semilocal approximation should (as SCAN does) capture the intermediate-range vdW through its exchange term. We have found an effective range of the vdW interaction between 8 and 16 \AA{} for systems considered here, suggesting that this interaction is negligibly small at the larger distances where it reaches its asymptotic power-law decay.},

Nonlocality also plays an important role in the optical spectrum and distribution of the modes but introduces complexity into calculations, hindering an analytical solution for interactions at the nanometer scale. Here, taking as an example the case of two touching nanospheres, we show for the first time, to our knowledge, that nonlocality in 3D plasmonic systems can be accurately analyzed using the transformation optics approach. The effects of nonlocality are found to dramatically weaken the field enhancement between the spheres and hence the van der Waals interaction and to modify the spectral shifts of plasmon modes.},

All atomic parameters have been optimized using reference data obtained from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. As a comprehensive test of our model, we have studied the frequency-dependent polarizabilities of quasi-spherical silver nanoclusters having different structural motifs, i.e., icosahedra, truncated Ino and Marks decahedra, and regular truncated octahedra and cubocahedra.

  volume = {112},
  doi = {10.1021/jp804116z},
  abstract = {In this work we have presented a capacitance-polarizability interaction model for describing the polarizability of large metal clusters. The model consists of interacting atomic capacitances and polarizabilities that are optimized to reproduce the full polarizability tensors of medium sized (N $\leq$ 68) gold and silver clusters. The reference polarizability tensors have been calculated using time-dependent density functional theory and shown good agreement with experimental results. We have shown that very good agreement between the model and the DFT results can be achieved both for the isotropic and anisotropic polarizability as a function of size, thus providing an accurate description of the polarizability of noble metal clusters. The model is computationally efficient and can easily handle cluster several nm in radius, thus, provides a natural bridge between the quantum mechanical methods and the macroscopic electrodynamic description. This allowed us to study the polarizability of silver and gold clusters having different shapes, i.e., spheres, rods, and disks, and sizes having diameters as large as 4.5 nm, thus, reaching the saturation of the polarizability. By partitioning the total polarizability into effective atomic polarizabilities that depend on the atomic position in the cluster, we provide a physical picture of the saturation of the polarizability of metal clusters as a function of size. This illustrates that the onset of the saturation occurs as the cluster starts to have a core of atoms showing bulk-like polarizabilities, surrounded by layers of atoms with surface-like polarizabilities. For larger clusters we see that the bulk core grows whereas the surface layers keep roughly the same thickness thus leading to a saturation of the polarizability as the size of the cluster increases.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.physletb.2016.08.036},
  abstract = {We present a simple general proof that Casimir force cannot originate from the vacuum energy of electromagnetic (EM) field. The full QED Hamiltonian consists of 3 terms: the pure electromagnetic term H em , the pure matter term H matt and the interaction term H int . The H em -term commutes with all matter fields because it does not have any explicit dependence on matter fields. As a consequence, H em cannot generate any forces on matter. Since it is precisely this term that generates the vacuum energy of EM field, it follows that the vacuum energy does not generate the forces. The misleading statements in the literature that vacuum energy generates Casimir force can be boiled down to the fact that H em attains an implicit dependence on matter fields by the use of the equations of motion and to the illegitimate treatment of the implicit dependence as if it was explicit. The true origin of the Casimir force is van der Waals force generated by H int .},

  doi = {10.1103/PhysRevA.65.012506},
  abstract = {Dynamic dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities as well as shielding factors of the beryllium atom in the ground state were computed at real frequencies by using the variation-perturbation method. The zeroth- and the first-order wave functions were expanded in many-electron basis of exponentially correlated Gaussian functions. The 1600-term expansion of the unperturbed wave function yielded the ground-state energy accurate to 1cm-1. The first-order wave functions were expanded in very large bases (4800 and 4400 terms). The nonlinear parameters of the first-order correction functions were optimized with respect to both the static and dynamic polarizabilities, and with respect to the excited-state energies. The procedure employed ensures a high accuracy of determination of dynamic properties in a wide range of frequencies and correct positions of the transition poles. Test calculations, performed on He and Li, confirmed the ability of this method to obtain the atomic properties with very high accuracy. The final values of the static properties of Be were 37.755e2a20E-1H and 300.96e2a40E-1H for the dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities, respectively, and 1.4769 for the quadrupole shielding factor. The convergence of the atomic properties with the size of the expansion of both the zeroth- and first-order functions was checked. Thanks to very high accuracy of the unperturbed wave function and the efficient method of construction of the first-order wave functions, the dynamic polarizability results presented in this work are of benchmark quality. As a by-product of this project, a set of the most accurate upper bounds to the energies of 1P and 1D states of Be was obtained.},

These simple systems show surprising diversity of electronic properties ranging from more ``metallic'' to more ``insulator'' like, a property which needs to be captured in the approximate methods. While none of the standard approximate DFT theories provides an entirely satisfactory description of all the systems, we identify the most reliable approaches of each type. In addition, we show that results can be further tuned to chemical accuracy. In vdW-DF theory, guided by physical insights and the availability of quasi-exact CCSD(T) results, we supply the missing parts of correlation by matching an appropriate hybrid/semilocal exchange-correlation functional to describe short-/medium-range correlations accurately. In the DFT-D-type of theories, we reparametrize the empirical dispersion term. Since for such an accurate treatment benchmark calculations are needed, which typically is feasible only for a finite cluster, we argue that the cluster based model of the exchange-correlation hole is transferrable also to extended systems with vdW dispersion interactions.},

  abstract = {Computationally efficient semilocal approximations of density functional theory at the level of the local spin density approximation (LSDA) or generalized gradient approximation (GGA) poorly describe weak interactions. We show improved descriptions for weak bonds (without loss of accuracy for strong ones) from a newly developed semilocal meta-GGA (MGGA), by applying it to molecules, surfaces, and solids. We argue that this improvement comes from using the right MGGA dimensionless ingredient to recognize all types of orbital overlap.},

  abstract = {By explicitly including fractionally ionic contributions to the polarizability of a many-component system, we are able to significantly improve on previous atom-wise many-body van der Waals approaches with essentially no extra numerical cost. For nonionic systems, our method is comparable in accuracy to existing approaches. However, it offers substantial improvements in ionic solids, e.g., producing better polarizabilities by over 65\% in some cases. It has particular benefits for two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides and interactions of H2 with modified coronenes, ionic systems of nanotechnological interest. It thus offers an efficient improvement on existing approaches, valid for a wide range of systems.},

  abstract = {Employing the random phase approximation we investigate the binding energy and Van der Waals (vdW) interlayer spacing between the two layers of bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 for five different stacking patterns, and examine the stacking-induced modifications on the electronic and optical/excitonic properties within the GW approximation with a priori inclusion of spin-orbit coupling and by solving the two-particle Bethe-Salpeter equation. Our results show that for all cases, the most stable stacking order is the high symmetry AA${'}$ type, distinctive of the bulklike 2H symmetry, followed by the AB stacking fault, typical of the 3R polytypism, which is by only 5 meV/formula unit less stable. The conduction band minimum is always located in the midpoint between K and $\Gamma$, regardless of the stacking and chemical composition. All MX2 undergo an direct-to-indirect optical gap transition going from the monolayer to the bilayer regime. The stacking and the characteristic vdW interlayer distance mainly influence the valence band splitting at K and its relative energy with respect to $\Gamma$, as well as, the electron-hole binding energy and the values of the optical excitations.},

  title = {Enhancing the Efficiency of Density Functionals with a Novel Iso-Orbital Indicator},
  abstract = {Due to its efficiency and reasonable accuracy, density functional theory is one of the most widely used electronic structure theories in condensed matter physics, materials physics, and quantum chemistry. The accuracy and efficiency of a density functional is dependent on the basic ingredients it uses, and how the ingredients are built into the functional as a whole. An iso-orbital indicator based on the electron density, its gradients, and the kinetic energy density, has proven an essential dimensionless variable that allows density functionals to recognise and correctly treat various types of chemical bonding, both strong and weak. Density functionals constructed around the iso-orbital indicator usually require dense real-space grids for numerical implementation that deteriorate computational efficiency, with poor grid convergence compromising the improved accuracy. Here, a novel iso-orbital indicator is proposed based on the same ingredients that retains the capability to identify the same chemical bonds while significantly relieving the requirement of dense grids, and giving an improved recognition for tail regions of electron densities. The novel iso-orbital indicator is therefore expected to be the prime choice for further density functional development.},

  abstract = {The most widely used density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy are inexact for one-electron systems. Their self-interaction errors can be severe in some applications. The problem is not only to correct the self-interaction error, but to do so in a way that will not violate size-consistency and will not go outside the standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory. The solution via the optimized effective potential (OEP) method will be discussed, first for the Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction (whose performance for molecules is briefly summarized) and then for the more modern self-interaction corrections based upon unitarily invariant indicators of iso-orbital regions. For the latter approaches, the OEP construction is greatly simplified. The kinetic-energy-based iso-orbital indicator TW $\sigma$(r)/T$\sigma$(r) will be discussed and plotted, along with an alternative exchange-based indicator.},
